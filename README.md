# Dine - Discover and share food recipes. 
Dine is a ongoing personal project where users should be able to discover and share food recipes. Users can create their own profiles and create recipes. There will be a profile page, with an overview over created recipes and liked recipes.  

The purpose of this project is to practice building webapplications with PHP, HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I am using MySQL for the database to this project. 

Live demo: https://dine1.herokuapp.com/ (Heroku app so might take some time to spin up)
